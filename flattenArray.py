# Write a function, flatten_array(), that takes in a 2-dimensional array,
# flattens it into a 1-dimensional array, and returns it.
# You can assume that you will only be given one or two-dimensional arrays

# For example, flatten_array([1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, [7, 8], 9]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
